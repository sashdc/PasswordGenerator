#  Module 3 : Javasript: Random Password Generator

## Overview

I have created a password generator that creates a password using all user-selected character sets and a user selected length between 8 and 128 characters.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

The page loads upon landing but the generator is activated by clicking the "Generate Password" button which leads to window prompts that will take in user selections for length and inclded character sets.

The final output is the randmly generated password in the box.
